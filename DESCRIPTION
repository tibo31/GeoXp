Description: A tool for researchers in spatial statistics,
        spatial econometrics, geography, ecology etc allowing to link
        dynamically statistical plots with elementary maps. This
        coupling consists in the fact that the selection of a zone on
        the map results in the automatic highlighting of the
        corresponding points on the statistical graph or reversely the
        selection of a portion of the graph results in the automatic
        highlighting of the corresponding points on the map. 'GeoXp'
        includes tools from different areas of spatial statistics
        including geostatistics as well as spatial econometrics and
        point processes (see for instance Bivand et al., 2013 <DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4614-7618-4>). 
        Besides elementary plots like boxplots,
        histograms or simple scatterplot, 'GeoXp' also couples with maps
        Moran scatterplots, variogram cloud, Lorentz Curves,...In order
        to make the most of the multidimensionality of the data, 'GeoXp'
        includes some dimension reduction techniques such as PCA.
